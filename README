This is provided as a Visual Studio 2013 project and compiles well on Windows.
No libraries other than SDL 1.2, SDL_Image 1.2, SDL_ttf 2.0 were used.

If attempting to compile, Please make sure to configure your additional library/include directories in the project settings, so it can find SDL's header and lib files for compilation/linkage.
